# Ud036 Homeworks with Py36 

The ‘Programming Foundations with Python’ ([Ud036](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud036)) is a wonderful class. It gives me the knowledge that I just need. If you feel that Python is a tool and you are not researching on the computer language itself, this is just right class. 

It would be better if it can introduce a little about ‘NumPy’; furthermore, the program of the class can be easier for Chinese students if it uses fewer resources from Google. We cannot access ‘Google’ or ‘YouTube’.

# Improvements 
Some usages of functions have changed to adapt Python 3.6.
